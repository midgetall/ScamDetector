Dear friend:
My name is Scammi Wazoo, son of the CEO of the Dupeyu Bank of Nigeria. Due to Political strife, I am unable to move my familyâ€™s savings of $20,000,000 (TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS) without it being traced by rebel roces. I am soliciting your help in transferring this money out of the country. If you would provide your business name or letterhead and name, address for verification, I will transfer these funds to your account for safekeeping. For your help in this, my family will let you keep $2,000,000 (TWO MIL- LION DOLLARS) of the money. I await your response. Sincerely,
Scammi Wazoo
